# CSVD Image Processing Pipelin

MR Image Processing Pipeline for CSVD project

The CSVD Project is a research study at the University of Rochester by co-PIs Giovanni Schifitto, MD and Sanjay Maggirwar, Ph.D.

The Imaging is performed on a 3T Siemens Prisma Research dedicated scanner and includes the following sequences:
  T1-MPRAGE; 1x1x1mm
  T2w; .5x.5x5.0mm
  FLAIR-3D; 1x1x1mm
  QSM; 8echo-bipolar; .9x.9x2mm
  mb-pcASL; 2.5x2.5x2.5mm; 5 PLDs
  DTI; 2-shell; 64-direction; 1.5x1.5x1.5mm
  rs-fMRI; BOLD; 2x2x2mm; TR=1.0s; 300 volumes
  Gradient fieldmaps for distortion correction
  TOF-MRA; For clinical use
  
Here you will find the image processing scripts I used for quantitative image analysis for all modalities except the TOF-MRA.
